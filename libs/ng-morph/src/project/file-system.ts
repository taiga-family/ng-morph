/**
 * A workspace path semantically is equivalent to the `Path` type provided by the
 * Angular devkit. Paths denoted with such a type are guaranteed to be representing
 * paths of a given virtual file system. This means that the root of a path can be
 * different, and does not necessarily need to match the root in the real file system.
 *
 * For example: Consider we have a project in `/home/<..>/my-project`. Then a path
 * like `/package.json` could actually refer to the `package.json` file in `my-project`.
 * Note that in the real file system this would not match though.
 *
 * One wonder why another type has been declared for such paths, when there already
 * is the `Path` type provided by the devkit. We do this for a couple of reasons:
 *
 *   1. The update-tool cannot have a dependency on the Angular devkit as that one
 *      is not synced into g3. We want to be able to run migrations in g3 if needed.
