        <strong>&#x40;taiga-ui/morph</strong>
        is a large set of tools for both global code base updates in your project and speeding up your work on Angular
        schematics. It has
        <a
            href="https://ts-morph.com/"
            tuiLink
        >
            ts-morph
        </a>
        under the hood and allows you to manipulate with safe TypeScript AST.
    </p>

        <h3>Why is it better than default schematics?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>🦅 You can quickly write migrations for your own project and run it as a simple script</li>

            <li>
                🛠 There are many tools made for working with Angular. You can easily find and manipulate TS and Ng
                entities.
            </li>

            <li>
                ✅ You work with an abstract tree and it can be replaced, for example, with virtual tree for testing
                instead of real file system. So, you can test your schematics rapidly fast.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>How to install</h3>

    <tui-doc-code code="npm i --save-dev ng-morph" />

    <p>
        You also need
        <code>&#64;angular-devkit/core</code>
        and
        <code>&#64;angular-devkit/schematics</code>
        to be installed.
    </p>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>

        <h3>How to run &#x40;taiga-ui/morph</h3>

        <h4>Running in your own project as a script</h4>

        <p>
            You can use &#x40;taiga-ui/morph for global updates of your porject code base, big refactiorings,
            dependencies migrations and much more. Just describe everything you want in a simple script and run it.
        </p>

        <tui-doc-code
            filename="script.ts"
            [code]="script"
        />

        <p>
            Now you can compile and run this script or just use something like
            <a
                href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node"
                rel="noreferrer"
                target="_blank"
                tuiLink
            >
                ts-node
            </a>
            that allows you to start TS script as soon as it is ready.
        </p>

        <h4>Creating schematics for publishing with libraries</h4>

        You can write schematics scripts to simplify your library installation or make fully automated migrations
        between releases with breaking changes.

        <p>
            Creating Angular
            <code>ng-add</code>
            or
            <code>ng-update</code>
            schematics you work with
            <a
                href="https://angular.io/guide/schematics-for-libraries#define-the-rule"
                rel="noreferrer"
                target="_blank"
                tuiLink
            >
                Rule
            </a>
            functions. Rule function gets a
            <code>Tree</code>
            as a first argument and you can pass this tree to
            <code>setActiveProject</code>
            function from ng-morph the following way:
        </p>

        <tui-doc-code
            filename="ng-add.ts"
            [code]="creatingRule"
        />
    </section>

        <h3>How to test your schematics</h3>

        <p>You can use any test runner you like to check that your schematics work as you expect.</p>

        <p>Let's try to test the migration above:</p>

        <tui-doc-code
            filename="ng-add.spec.ts"
            [code]="creatingSpec"
        />
    </section>

        <h3>What is next?</h3>

        <p>
            So, now you know how to set it up. Give a star to
            <a
                href="https://github.com/taiga-family/ng-morph"
                rel="noreferrer"
                target="_blank"
                tuiLink
            >
                our project on Github
            </a>
            and start exploring utils in the left menu to find all the tools you need. We suggest you to start with
            <a
                routerLink="/classes"
                tuiLink
            >
                Classes
            </a>
        </p>
